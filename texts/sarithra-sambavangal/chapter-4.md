The Valour of the Rajput clan is a world-renowned wonder .The bravery of the Rajput clan is second to no  other clan in this world . T
The Rajputs are honest and ever-thankful . It is said that even a coward who hears of the Rajput’s Valour will swing his sword .

This story dates back to 300 years ago . Raja Rao Chatrasal was the ruler of Pandi . The Mughals exercised a lot of power during this time period . It was the Mughal Ruler Shah Jahan who had helped Chhatrasal to power . Earlier the Rajputs and the Mughals used to be sworn enemies , but after Akbar made many matrimonial alliances with the Rajputs their relations had improved . 

Chhatrasal was extremely loyal to Shah Jahan . He belonged to the ‘Hara’ tribe.  He had won around 52 wars for Shah Jahan and had established himself as a great warrior . 

Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had 4 sons - Dara , Shuja , Murad , Aurangazeb . Dara was the oldest and the other 3 were younger . Shah Jahan had split his empire into 4 parts , and had sent his sons as representatives for each of the parts . Although he had the fame of constructing the world-renown Taj Mahal , his last-leg of life did not pass pleasantly . A war of succession , which had been brewing for quite some time , erupted all of a sudden . The sons raised the flag of war against their own father . The younger sons did not like Dara , to occupy the throne as the eldest son . In particular , Aurangazeb wanted all the power for himself . He was very cunning and could do anything to achieve whatever he wanted .

When the war of succession started , Aurangazeb was in the Deccan region . Chhatrasal was with him there . Shah Jahan had sent him as a guardian and advisor for Aurangazeb . Aurangzeb knew about Chatrasal’s bravery . So he asked him to rebel against Shah Jahan and fight for him when the war started . Chhatrasal refused point blank . He was a loyal soldier after all !

Sensing that the Emperor's life could be in danger because of his sons , Chatrasal wanted to leave for Delhi immediately . But Aurangazeb knew of his loyalty , and ordered him to be killed in his hut . But Chatrasal knew Aurangazeb would stop him from going to Delhi, , and had evacuated his hut the previous night.
 
Chatrasal left for Delhi with his men and other loyalists . They were ready to give their life for the sake of Shah Jahan . They wore Orange-colored clothes . Whenever a Rajput wears orange colored clothes , it means that they are in a ‘Do or Die’ mentality . Aurangazeb’s army did not expect Chatrasals men to fight back , and stood in shock for some time .

Aurangazeb’s forces chased Chhatrasal upto the banks of the Narmada river . At that time , the Narmada was overflowing on both sides . Chatrasal and his men had to cross this river to get to the emperor . But it was nearly impossible to cross the furiously raging and overflowing river . 
An overflowing river is not enough to stop the Rajput’s bravery . Will the Rajput bravery stop within themselves ? It flowed in their horses as well ! The horses swam to the other side , in freezing cold water . This way Chatrasal and his men reached Delhi   . Aurangazeb could not do anything except watch .

Because of the recent rebellions , Shah Jahan was heartbroken and ill. His daughter , Jahannara , stayed with him . Jahannara had a special affection towards Dara , who was the eldest and the heir to the throne according to tradition . She heard of Chatrasal’s coming and sent him her earrings . When a woman sends a man her earrings , he has to accept her as his sister . This was a Rajput tradition . Chatrasal accepted Jahannara as his sister  , and joined forces with Dara to fight the other princes .

The Rajputs fought with their usual valour .  In the battlefield , someone had given Dara wrong information about the enemies , and Dara got off his war elephant . This made the Rajputs think that Dara had fallen dead , and they began to scamper away from the battlefield . But Chatrasal Stood like a rock . He said to his fleeing soldiers 
“ Those who run from the battlefield are cowards , worthy to be scorned at and disrespected . I have eaten Shah Jahan’s salt and must be loyal to him , I will either return victorious , or be slain on this battlefield .”

After hearing their leader give such a powerful speech the warriors became courageous and returned to the battlefield . Chatrasal summoned his battle elephant and rode it . When an enemy cannonball hit the elephant , it ran away in pain . Chatrasal got off it and said “My elephant may run with fear from this field , but its commander will not turn away an inch “ . He summoned his favourite battle horse Javadiya .   Just as he swung his arm to charge a spear at Murad , an enemy cannonball knocked his head off his body , and he lay dead . That day a brave and loyal warrior sacrificed his life for Shah Jahan .

Betrayal , Cunningness and vengeance won , Aurangazeb killed all his brothers and came to power . He imprisoned his own father till he died . This is the truth history holds . Similarly , Chatrasal sacrificed his own life  to show his loyalty and thankfulness . This is also a record that history holds .

Chhatrasal was not only a great warrior . He was a great devotee of lord krishna and had an eye for art . He constructed a temple called ‘Kishor’ in Patan . Till date  , There exists a fort called ‘Chatramahal’ in his remembrance , in Pandi.
