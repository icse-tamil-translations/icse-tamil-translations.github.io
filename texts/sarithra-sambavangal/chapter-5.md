The birthplace of bravery is Rajasthan. The Rajputs of this region are famed for their brave deeds.  They are ready to sacrifice their life for honour’s sake. 

Uday Simman was the Son of the great Rana Sangha. He led a life of great luxury and indulged in pleasures. He was considered a disgrace to the Rajput clan. It was under his reign that Mewar lost much of its territory to the Mughals. The people hated him because of this.

Once, unable to stop Akbar from conquering Chittor, he escaped to a safer place along with his sons. He left the responsibility of guarding  Chittor on two Rajput youths - Jaimal and Putta. One was 16, while the other was 17! 

The much famed and sacred capital of the Rajputs, was in the hands of two youths now! It might be amusing to think how two youths were expected to protect a big city from Akbar’s army. In Mewar, there were 16 royal families. These families had the responsibility of protecting Chittor when required. Since Jaimal And Putta belonged to these royal families they were tasked with protecting Chittor. Both of their fathers had died fighting for Chittor. 

The common people were happy because a ruler who did not protect his citizens and country had left  their country now. "We will not sacrifice our motherland at any cost. We shall protect it, even if we have to lay down our lives for it ” said the brave Rajputs.

Putta’s mother sent his son to battle, wearing an orange dress. This was not the dress saints wear. When a Rajput wears the orange dress, it means "either victory or martyrdom”. Putta’s mother joined with the other brave women of Chittor. They thought "The king has left a chittor in our hands. The brave Rajputs are on the battlefield. It is our duty to help them. If the enemy captures  Chittor, we will not have time to light a fire and attain an honourable death. We will become slaves of the enemy”.

Putta’s mother said "Those who do not want to be pushed to that shameful fate come along with me to the battlefield. Those who wish to live can remain here ". All the Rajput women took up arms and followed Putta’s Mothers Command. On that day many wives and mothers showed their bravery and went heavenward. Upon seeing their bravery, even the cowards began to fight. The Rajputs put up such a great display of courage which had not been seen before. Even the Mughals were amazed that the Rajputs wished to die.

After Putta’s wife and mother fought with the enemies and attained martyrdom, Putta’s bravery grew exponentially. He swung his sword and many heads fell to the ground. Just after, he was slain by the Mughals. Jaimal rushed to take his place. The Rajputs fought with renewed vigour now. They should have won that war. But luck was not on their side. One of Akbar's bullets slew Jaimal and there was no one to take his place. The remaining Rajputs became confused and were ultimately killed. Akbar went into Chittor, with the blood-stained clothes of the soldiers as his carpet. 

Akbar himself was a great warrior. True to the warrior spirit after seeing the bravery of Jaimal and Putta he said "These two 16 year olds have done wonders on the battlefield. Am I going to occupy this same country which raised such Bravehearts!”. Akbar wanted to honour the two warriors and make their bravery immortal. He designed a Statue of the two riding their elephants near the entrance of his palace at Delhi, to honour their bravery.
