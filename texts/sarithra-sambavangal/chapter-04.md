The Valour of the Rajput clan is a world-renowned wonder. The bravery of the Rajput clan is second to no other clan in this world. T
The Rajputs are honest and ever-thankful. It is said that even a coward who hears of the Rajput's Valour will swing his sword.

This story dates back to 300 years ago. Raja Rao Chatrasal was the ruler of Pandi. The Mughals exercised a lot of power during this time period. It was the Mughal Ruler Shah Jahan who had helped Chhatrasal to power. Earlier the Rajputs and the Mughals used to be sworn enemies, but after Akbar made many matrimonial alliances with the Rajputs their relations had improved. 

Chhatrasal was extremely loyal to Shah Jahan. He belonged to the 'Hara' tribe. He had won around 52 wars for Shah Jahan and had established himself as a great warrior. 

Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had 4 sons - Dara, Shuja, Murad, Aurangazeb. Dara was the oldest and the other 3 were younger. Shah Jahan had split his empire into 4 parts, and had sent his sons as representatives for each of the parts. Although he had the fame of constructing the world-renown Taj Mahal, his last-leg of life did not pass pleasantly. A war of succession, which had been brewing for quite some time, erupted all of a sudden. The sons raised the flag of war against their own father. The younger sons did not like Dara, to occupy the throne as the eldest son. In particular, Aurangazeb wanted all the power for himself. He was very cunning and could do anything to achieve whatever he wanted.

When the war of succession started, Aurangazeb was in the Deccan region. Chhatrasal was with him there. Shah Jahan had sent him as a guardian and advisor for Aurangazeb. Aurangzeb knew about Chatrasal's bravery. So he asked him to rebel against Shah Jahan and fight for him when the war started. Chhatrasal refused point blank. He was a loyal soldier after all!

Sensing that the Emperor's life could be in danger because of his sons, Chatrasal wanted to leave for Delhi immediately. But Aurangazeb knew of his loyalty, and ordered him to be killed in his hut. But Chatrasal knew Aurangazeb would stop him from going to Delhi,, and had evacuated his hut the previous night.
 
Chatrasal left for Delhi with his men and other loyalists. They were ready to give their life for the sake of Shah Jahan. They wore Orange-colored clothes. Whenever a Rajput wears orange colored clothes, it means that they are in a 'Do or Die' mentality. Aurangazeb's army did not expect Chatrasals men to fight back, and stood in shock for some time.

Aurangazeb's forces chased Chhatrasal upto the banks of the Narmada river. At that time, the Narmada was overflowing on both sides. Chatrasal and his men had to cross this river to get to the emperor. But it was nearly impossible to cross the furiously raging and overflowing river. 
An overflowing river is not enough to stop the Rajput's bravery. Will the Rajput bravery stop within themselves ? It flowed in their horses as well! The horses swam to the other side, in freezing cold water. This way Chatrasal and his men reached Delhi . Aurangazeb could not do anything except watch.

Because of the recent rebellions, Shah Jahan was heartbroken and ill. His daughter, Jahannara, stayed with him. Jahannara had a special affection towards Dara, who was the eldest and the heir to the throne according to tradition. She heard of Chatrasal's coming and sent him her earrings. When a woman sends a man her earrings, he has to accept her as his sister. This was a Rajput tradition. Chatrasal accepted Jahannara as his sister, and joined forces with Dara to fight the other princes.

The Rajputs fought with their usual valour. In the battlefield, someone had given Dara wrong information about the enemies, and Dara got off his war elephant. This made the Rajputs think that Dara had fallen dead, and they began to scamper away from the battlefield. But Chatrasal Stood like a rock. He said to his fleeing soldiers 
" Those who run from the battlefield are cowards, worthy to be scorned at and disrespected. I have eaten Shah Jahan's salt and must be loyal to him, I will either return victorious, or be slain on this battlefield."

After hearing their leader give such a powerful speech the warriors became courageous and returned to the battlefield. Chatrasal summoned his battle elephant and rode it. When an enemy cannonball hit the elephant, it ran away in pain. Chatrasal got off it and said "My elephant may run with fear from this field, but its commander will not turn away an inch ". He summoned his favourite battle horse Javadiya. Just as he swung his arm to charge a spear at Murad, an enemy cannonball knocked his head off his body, and he lay dead. That day a brave and loyal warrior sacrificed his life for Shah Jahan.

Betrayal, Cunningness and vengeance won, Aurangazeb killed all his brothers and came to power. He imprisoned his own father till he died. This is the truth history holds. Similarly, Chatrasal sacrificed his own life to show his loyalty and thankfulness. This is also a record that history holds.

Chhatrasal was not only a great warrior. He was a great devotee of lord krishna and had an eye for art. He constructed a temple called 'Kishor' in Patan. Till date, There exists a fort called 'Chatramahal' in his remembrance, in Pandi.
