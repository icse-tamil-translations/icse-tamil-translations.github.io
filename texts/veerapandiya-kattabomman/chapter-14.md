"After yesterday's investigation, I have to mention how Veerapandiya Kattabomman stood fearless and in a mocking way.

When he was walking, he was repeatedly staring angrily at Ettappan Nayakkan and Sivagiri King, who helped Bannerman to capture Veerapandiya Kattabomman. While Veerapandiya Kattabomman was walking with bravery and heroism, he was staring at the people who were standing at the left and right side of him.

While walking to the area where he was to be executed, I got the news of how Veerapandiya Kattabomman was showing concern for his brother. After he reached the tree, he also showed concern about leaving his fort. He also mentioned how he would be happier if he died while defending his fort."
-From this, we can learn about the mental state of Kattabomman.

At October 5th, 1799 he was thrown into a building in Kayattharu till Oct 16 *(sic)* after coming as a prisoner from Madurai. 

After 16 days, the English men were telling Kattabomman that if he would pay money to the English, Paanjalankuricchi would be revived. But Kattabomman told boldly that "Being dead is greater than living by paying to the English men".

In october 16, 1799 there was a horse army under the leadership of Turner, and there was a group of soldiers under the leadership of Douglas. Then Bannerman started his investigation with Kattabomman and listed all the crimes committed by Kattabomman:
 - Crime of not paying the tax money
 - Crime of not properly respecting Jackson Durai during their meeting
 - Crime of killing Lieutenant Clark
 - Crime of refusing to meet Loosingtan and delaying the meeting
 - Crime of not coming to the terms of the British and causing them loss of soldiers and weapons

Like this he kept on listing all the crimes committed by Kattabomman. Then Kattabomman said, "These are not crimes in my eyes. Me not paying money to you, a foreigner, is the right thing done by me to preserve the culture of this soil. You have listed all the other crimes based on this. If the root crime is wrong, everything else is wrong. Anyways I am done with this investigation. Now, fulfil your wish of hanging me." The investigation then ended. Bannerman announced his final verdict of hanging Kattabomman.

Bannerman offered one last offer to the dispute between him and Kattabomman. Kattabomman was taken to the tree in which he was going to be hanged. One of the Englishmen climbed the tree and hung the ropem while other one placed a ladder near the gallows rope. Finally, Kattabomman climbed the ladder, tied the noose on himself, and kicked the ladder. The soul of Kattabomman parted with his lifeless body.

Bannerman desired to make an example out of Kattabomman. He wanted everyone to see this, hence he hung the lifeless body of Kattabomman in the tree for 2 hours.
When Oomaithurai burned Kattabomman’s body as part of the ritual *(Hindu funeral rites)*, it was said that the flames themselves wept upon touching Kattabomman’s body. After Kattabomman died, the 42 forts in Thirunelveli were destoyed including Panjalankuricchi’s fort.

Vijay Rangunathan Thondaiman was rewarded by the English for helping them capture Kattabomman. They declared that he and Pudhukottai never have to pay tax to the English ever again. The successors of Vijay could rule without any hindrance.

Also the English rewarded Ettappan with the village "Sivanyanapuram" for his contribution in the capture of Kattabomman. The 79 villages present in Paanjalankuricchi was annexed into Ettayapuram. The English gave rewards to all those who helped them capture Kattabomman. VPk was born in 3.1.1760 and died on 16.10.1799. He lived for 39 years. It has been 204 years since he passed away and many more to come. But Wherever there is a freedom battle, he will be remembered fondly.
