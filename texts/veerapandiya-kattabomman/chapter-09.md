Lusington was desperate to bring Kattobomman under British control. Lusington worried that he might end up like Alan Durai, Maxwell and Jackson Durai and fail to subdue Kattabomman. 

Lusington concluded that there was no use in holding talks with Kattabomman, who was clearly not interested in it. Therefore he thought it best to meet Kattabomman with weapons rather than words. He wrote a letter to the governor, stating "We will have to deal with Kattabomman on the battlefield now. Only if we subdue Kattabomman will the other kingdoms respect us and pay tax to us. Therefore I request you to send orders to capture Panjalankurichi, along with the required soldiers as soon as possible "

The higher officials deliberated on this matter and finally decided to attack Panjalankurichi. 

On sept 4 1799, a 4-thousand men strong army, headed by major John Bannerman of Palaiyankottai, was dispatched to Panjalankurichi. When the attack happened, Minister Danapathi Pillai was in Atroor - his hometown. Oomaidurai, and many other soldiers were on pilgrimage to Thiruchendur to worship their deity Jackammal. 

It was Ettapa Nayakan, the ruler of Ettayapuram, who had given the British the information that Danapathi Pillai, Oomaithurai and other key soldiers would not be in Panjalankuruchi at that time! The British surrounded Panjalankurichi fort. O'Reilly, Bruce, Douglas, Collins, Blake, Barmeekes and other British commanders surrounded the fort, waiting for the best time to attack. Ettappa Nayakan also sent 1000 men to help the British. The British forces from Kayathaaru and Kovilpatti also arrived to help them. A regiment of horses, led by ieutenant Douglas also surrounded Panjalankurichi, 

Vellaiya thevan, Sundaralingam, Veera Badhra Pillai (Danapathi Pillai's brother) and Chithaiya Nayakar were all waiting for the command of Kattabomman to attack the British. Banerman sent Dubash Ramalinga Mudaliar, Havildar Ibrahim Khan and Arikkaaran Saami to meet Kattabomman inside the fort. 

Because the 3 were sent as messengers and their intention was not to fight, Kattabomman's guards let them in without opposing. Ramalinga Mudaliar said to Kattabomman "Your minister Danapathi Pillai has to be handed over to us, and the tax is to be payed, or else there will be huge consequences. Bannerman sent me to ask of your opinion and return "

Kattabomman replied "First they ask me for undue tax money. Because I blatantly refused, they ask me to turn in my minister now. Since the British are so determined, they force me to make a decision as well"

"My minister was not involved in the Srivaigundam incident that the British accused him of. In fact, such an incident never happened at all. If indeed, my minister is guilty of such a crime, it is upto me and the people of this land to punish him. Why should I turn in my minister to the British, who do not even belong here "
"I know the reason they are desperate to get my minister. First they will take him, then they will take me, then the whole of Panjalankurichi. This is their plan. But it will never succeed, as long as I live. You may leave now!" 

The messengers were forced to return to Bannerman. After hearing from the messengers Bannerman raged with fury. On Sept 5 1799 at around 8 Am, he launched an attack on the North-western part of Panchalankurichi fort.
