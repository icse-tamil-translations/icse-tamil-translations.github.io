Veerapandiyan started growing as a valourous child. He learnt several martial arts right from his early age. Next to Veerapandiyan, his parents gave birth to another boy. He was named Kumarasamy. That child wasn't able to speak right from the beginning. Even though his parents tried to rectify it, the ailment couldn't be cured. However, that child was skilled in martial arts and became a talented warrior. He would grow up to become a right hand for Veerapandiya Kattabomman. He was fondly called by the people as Oomaithurai *(the dumb chief)*.

Next to that Veerapandiya Kattabomman's parents had another male child. He was named Durai Singam. After this, his parents begot two daughters named Isvara vadivu and Durai Kannu. Thus Veerapandiya Kattabomman had grown up with two younger brothers and two younger sisters. Later in due time, Veerapandiya Kattabomman was married to a lady named Veerajakkammal. Then Veerapandiya Kattabomman became the 47th king of Panchalankurichi. He divided the 96 villages under Panchalankurichi into six zones and ruled in fair and just manner. His brother Oomaithurai assisted him as a chief commander.

In a region called Vallanadu, there was an adolescent cowherd boy called Vellaiyan. Once a few robbers tried to steal the cattle from his neighbouring villages. This boy single-handedly confronted the robbers and chased them away. The news of this incident reached Kattabomman's ears. So he summoned Vellaiyan to his court, offered him a title Bahadur and appointed him as a commander in his army. This Vellaiyan later came to be known as Bahadur Vellaiya thevan. Since Veerapandiya Kattabomman did not have any offspring, Vellaiya thevan was appointed as the next heir to the throne. 

There lived a couple Katta karuppanan and Mutharuli in a village named Gevunagiripalli next to Panchalankurichi. They had a son named Sundaralingam. That boy was trained in martial arts from a young age under the tutelage of Naganar at a place called Kollanginaru. When Veerapandiya Kattabomman came to know of Sundaralingam's valour, he appointed Sundaralingam as a commander in his army. Sundaralingam later added several able soldiers from his community to Veerapandiya Kattabomman's army. 

There was a minister named Subramania pillai who served at the court of Veerapandiya Kattabomman. He was more famously known as Danapathi pillai. Thus Veerapandiya Kattabomman had members from various communities in various posts in his government. His team was solely based on merit and those with talent were welcomed irrespective of their family background. Veerapandiya Kattabomman with the strategic planning ability of Danapathi pillai and agile warriors like Oomaithurai, Vellaiya thevan and Katta karuppan Sundaralingam became a formbidable force among all other neighbouring Palayams. No one dared to mess with Panchalankurichi as they all feared the strength of Kattabomman's kingdom. In this way, the first three years of Kattabomman's rule was very impressive without any hindrances or opposition. But soon after that, trouble started to creep in.
