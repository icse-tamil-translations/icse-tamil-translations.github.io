As soon as he heard that Panjalankurichi fort was surrounded by the British, Oomaidurai and other soldiers returned from their pilgrimage and disguised themselves to enter the fort secretly. The British who were waiting to capture them could not sense anything.

The British force that was sent to arrest Danapathi pillai in his hometown also returned empty-handed. The minister too, had escaped secretly to Panjalankurichi. 

Bannerman was not shocked that his forces could not capture Oomaidurai and Danapathi Pillai, but more so at the fact that they secretly entered the fort without arousing suspicion.

Kattabomman discussed the war-tactic they would use in this war with Danapathi Pillai, Oomaidurai, Sundaralingam and Vellaiya Thevan. Finally it was decided that each entrance to the fort would be guarded by a commander, with hundreds of soldiers under him. The security around the walls of the fort was also strengthened. 

Bannerman did not know of Kattabomman's war strategy, as he was outside the fort and he stood in confusion. He also wrongly assumed that a few of his modern weapons would be enough to knock down Panjalankurichi fort. Bannerman ordered his men to attack the North and South sides of the fort. The soldiers of etappa nayakan tried to climb over the walls of the fort, but they were stabbed as soon as they fell inside, making their attempt futile. The bullets of the British fell passively when the hit the walls of the fort. The warriors of Kattabomman fought bravely and were victorious. Spears and Swords won over Cannons and Explosives that day! Oomaidurai and Vellaiya Thevan fought like furious tornadoes, sucking the life out of the enemies.
