The night Vellaiya Thevan was killed, Kattabomman wept inconsolably. He was extremely depressed that both Sundaralingam and Vellaiya Thevan, whom he had considered his heir, had both lost their lives.

Kattabomman, who had consoled thousands of people, could not be consoled now by Danapathi Pillai and Oomaithurai. All of them thought about what had to be done next. Danapathi Pillai said "The loss of Sundaralingam and Vellaiya Thevan are the two biggest gains for our enemies. On top of that, Bannerman acknowledged that fighting us was not as easy as he had thought and he has requested 24-pound cannonballs and more soldiers. With our current army, we will not be able to oppose the strengthened British, Therefore I suggest that we escape from here to Trichy and talk things out with the higher officials there". Oomaithurai immediately opposed this suggestion. Kattabomman's group  deliberated for a long time, and finally decided to follow Danapathi Pillai's plan. 

On Sept 7, 1799, around 10:30 pm, Kattabomman escaped from Panjalankurichi fort toward Naagalaapuram, with 50 soldiers, 7 horses, and a few of his trusted generals for company. 

The Naagalaapuram ruler, Iravappa Nayakar, welcomed Kattabomman with open arms. Kattabomman informed him about what had happened so far and his intention to go to Trichy . Kattabomman continued his journey through Kosukundi towards Kolarpatti. 

Bannerman sent a letter to all the small-kingdoms in the Nellai region and others, labelling Kattabomman as a troublemaker, and wrote 
"His kingdom was captured because he refused to oblige. Kattabomman. who ran away from Panjalankurichi, is hiding in some kingdom. Those who offer protection to him will be considered as enemies of the British. The person who turns him in, will get a suitable reward" 

To capture Kattabomman, Bannerman went to Naagalaapuram. He got the news that Kattabomman had escaped from there, and was in Kolarpatti. 

Two horse regiments, under lieutenant Douglas, 400 bombers under O rielly, and Ettapa Nayaakan's men surrounded Kollarpatti. 

On september 10, 1799, Bitter warfare broke out between the British and Kattabomman's side. 37 British soldiers lost their lives, and 16 of Kattabomman's warriors were slain. In the end, the British emerged victorious. 

Danapathi Pillai, His brother Veerabadhra Pillai, Aadanur Vellaisaami Nayakar, Alikkulam Subba Nayakar, Mullupatti Muthaiya Nayakar, Kollam Parappu Kumarasaami Nayakar, along with 34 others, were captured as war hostages. 

Kattabomman escaped on his horse along with 6 other men. 

Daanapathi Pillai, who was captured in the war of Kolaarpatti, was hung on a neem tree near Naagalaapuram. After he was hung, Bannerman cut his head off his body, and sent his head to Paanjalankurichi to be hung outside the palace. His body was left on the streets of Nagalaapuram.

Since Kattabomman had escaped, Bannerman wanted to punish all those who had helped him. Bannerman was especially angry at the Naagalapuram Kingdom, which had offered asylum when Kattabomman fled Panjalankurichi fort. 

The brother of Nagalaapuram's king, Soundara Pandiya Nayakar was captured by the British, and hung on September 13, 1799 near Ramanathapuram 

Nagalaapuram's administrator SaathurPillai, Kolarpatti's ruler Soundaralinga Nayakar, Kulathur's minister Aarumugam Pillai, Kaadalkudi's minister Gomathinayakam Pillai, and Ezhaiyiram Pannai's minister Dharmaperumal Pillai were all exiled by the British. 

Naagalapuram's ruler Iravappa Nayakar, Ezhaiyiram Pannai's king Kaalai Vanniyar, and Kulathur's prince Vettur Nayakar were all arrested and thrown into the prison at Chennai.

Kattabomman sped on northwards, on his favourite horse Muthurami.
