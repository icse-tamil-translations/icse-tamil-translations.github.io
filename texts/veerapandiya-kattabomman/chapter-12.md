Bannerman was shocked to hear that his ammunition had been burned up. He also rejoiced at the fact that One of Kattabomman's closest aide's and best warriors - Sundaralingam, had been killed. 

Bannerman decided to attack Panjalankurichi fort from its Southern side. Kattabomman's crew decided to make Oomaithurai guard the Northern Entrance, and Vellaiya Thevan guard the Southern entrance. 

The Southern entrance was attacked by a huge force under command of Collins. The warriors of Panjalankurichi had been stopping the British from entering by throwing spears at them. Inside the fort Vellaiya Thevan and his regiment were ready to battle anything. After some time, The Southern Entrance's gateway broke and fell because of the heavy firing. Collin's men rushed inside Panchalankurichi fort. Collins became prey to Vellaiaya Thevan's spear, as he attempted to enter the fort. Seeing their commander fall, the British forces were scared and ran away and hid themselves outside the fort. 

After hearing that Collins was slain by Vellaiya, Thevan Bannerman was shocked. Now he wanted to slay Vellaiya Thevan.

The battle continued to the next day. Bannerman searched specifically for Vellaiya Thevan. Bannerman announced that there would be a reward for the person who found Vellaiya Thevan and killed him. Still, no one was able to spot Vellaiya Thevan.

There was one particular youth who fought with great bravery. He caused the fall of hundreds of Englishmen. His greedy uncle turned him in to the Britishers, in hopes of getting the reward. They caught hold of him and removed his Turban and Fake beard. It turned out this youth was none other than Vellaiya Thevan. The Britishers stabbed him with a spear and killed him. 

Kattabomman was left heartbroken after two of his close associates - Sundaralingam and Vellaiya Thevan, had been killed by the Britishers. 

Even after causing so much loss to Panjalankurichi, Bannerman thought that he would not be able to enter the fort easily. He wrote to higher officials at Palayamkottai 
"24 pound cannonballs, and a few more soldiers are required to defeat Panjalankurichi. Only then can we arrest Kattabomman". His request was accepted and the war began again. Both the sides had a marked increase in the loss of life.

Finally, on 9th september 1799, Panjalankurichi fort was captured by the Britishers. Under Bannerman, the British entered the fort. They searched each and every place for Kattabomman. During this search they marvelled at the strength and structure of Panchalankurichi fort. Even after searching through the whole of the fort Kattabomman was not found. The Britishers then unleashed this anger on the fort, wrecking many of the items inside it. Bannerman was infuriated when he heard that Kattabomman had escaped from the fort.
