## [Veerapandiya Kattabomman](texts/veerapandiya-kattabomman)

## [Sarithra Sambavangal](texts/sarithra-sambavangal)

Sarithra Sambavangal literally means "Historical Incidents". It is written by **Vaandu Mama**, and published by **Gangai Puthaga Nilayam**. It's not a contiguous story, moreso a collection of several historical stories set throughout the myriad of ages and places of India. From the valorous Maharana Pratap's fight against the Mughals, to the quest of a Pallava sculptor boy's quest to find his father. Vaandu Mama, in the foreword of this book, expresses his view that he's only been able to capture a mere water droplet, compared to the ocean of stories that India contains.
